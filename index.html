  </h2>
  <p>
    The Information Security Talent Search (ISTS) competition is an annual
    three-day cyber <span class="red">attack</span>/
    <span class="blue">defend</span> competition hosted at the
    <a href="https://www.rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> by
    RITSEC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each year, colleges from around the country compete for the coveted title
    of ISTS champion. Competitors are faced with a wide variety of challenges
    which are designed to cover as many facets of computing security, system
    administration, networking, and programming as we possibly can. These
    challenges include code review, architecture design, incident response, and
    policy writing -- all while defending a completely student-built
    infrastructure.

    From day one of competition planning, ISTS is built from the ground up by
    students. All of the planning, scheduling, building, and outreach is done
    by members of RITSEC. Additionally, competitor skills are put to the test
    by adding an external <span class="red">red team</span> of security
    professionals including industry partners and passionate alumni. The red
    team performs offensive actions against the competitors during the entire
    competition. Notable red team members of past ISTS competitions include
    <a href="https://twitter.com/armitagehacker">Raphael Mudge</a> (creator of Cobalt Strike), <a href="https://twitter.com/carnal0wnage">Chris Gates</a> (carnal0wnage), and
